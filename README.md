# Architecture
* Flickr Images project is implemented using MVVM architecture pattern.
* The Model layer is responsible for representing the data from our business logic. The Model doesnâ€™t know any other layer.
* The ViewModel layer is responsible for transforming the data received in a View representative way, receiving actions from the View, dealing with our business logic.
* The View layer is responsible for handling all the layouts and displaying the data user-friendly. The View knows the ViewModel but doesn't know the model.

# Running the tests
* Project contains tests written using the built-in framework XCTest.
